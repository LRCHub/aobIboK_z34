Early in the morning
The world is waking up
Early in the morning
Right now, the going's getting tough
I can't stop from yawning
'Cause I've never got to bed
Early in the morning
Tell me what I'll do instead

I've been out with the boys
We got together, made a whole lotta noise
We messed around the whole night through
But now I'm coming down with the morning dew

Early in the morning
The birds are still in their nest
Early in the morning
And I wish I got me some rest
See, the day is dawning
And I'm out on the street again
Early in the morning
My world is looking gray

I had a neon dream that lasted all night
Had so much fun and it felt so right
Everybody's a long lost friend
One thing about the night is it has to end

Early in the morning
And my eyelids feel like lead
Early in the morning
Looks like I'm the only sleepyhead
Never heard the warning
"The night life will kill you," my mama said
Early in the morning
People stop and stare
I don't feel right here
I'd better disappear

Early in the morning
It's gonna be early in the morning
It's gonna be early in the morning
It's gonna be early in the morning
It's gonna be
